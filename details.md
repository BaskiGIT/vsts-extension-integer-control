## Customize your work item form with a up/down control ##

Easily change your integer values with a up/down control on the work item form (ex. Hit Count for bugs). 

The control can be used by both your mouse and keyboard (up and down arrow keys).

## Quick steps to get started ##

1. Navigate to your work item form and choose which field (integer) you would like to replace with the toggle control.

2. Learn about how to customize the up/down control directly on XML [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-integer-wit-custom-control/blob/master/README.md) for TFS.
